# Attendance Manager

## Description
Attendance Manager is a web application designed to handle attendance records for colleges. This project was developed for academic purposes, but there may be mistakes in its implementation. If you find it useful, feel free to refer to it. Unfortunately, my college has declined to use this application as a senior student has developed another one. Hence, I am making it public. You can also gain insights by analyzing the code.

## Installation
To use Attendance Manager, you will need Python and Django installed on your system. If the terminal indicates that certain libraries are missing, please install them.

## Usage
You can utilize Attendance Manager for your own projects or as an attendance management system for colleges or schools.
